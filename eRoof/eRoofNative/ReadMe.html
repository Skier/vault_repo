<h2>
This project has been generated by the Intuit Developer Network QuickBase Project wizard.
</h2>
<p>Your <b>eRoofNative.mxml</b> file, originally created as a shell by Flex has been set up with 
the boilerplate code for a QuickBase project.  This application should successfully compile and run,
allowing you to login to QuickBase and select a QuickBase application to connect with.  The default
project file sets the QBApp to filter the list of available QuickBase applications using eRoofNative, if
you want your QuickBase to have a different name, update the <code>appRegEx</code> attribute of the QBApp tag in 
$$APP_NAME.mxml</p>  

<p>Applications that use the QuickBase framework library (Kingussie) are implemented using a 
<em>model-view-controller</em> architecture pattern (see the QuickBase SDK documentation for details
of our specific implementation, or Google "Model-View-Controller" for more general information
regarding this architectural pattern.</p>  

<p><b>MODEL:</b> Your application's main model, which includes a reference to the framework QuickBaseMSAModel base 
model is implemented as a singleton object in <b>D:/_work/IPP/eRoof/eRoofNative/src/com/ebs/eroofmodel/eRoofNativeModel.as</b>.  Your model 
should contain variables and accessors for the data that will be displayed in your view and manipulated by 
your controller.</p>

<p><b>VIEW:</b>  Your application's main UI should be implemented in <b>D:/_work/IPP/eRoof/eRoofNative/src/com/ebs/eroofview/eRoofNativeView.mxml</b>, 
which has also been set up with the necessary boilerplate code to respond to the QUICKBASE_READY event from
the QBApp.  The view is responsible for presenting data to the user and for responding to user gestures, user
gestures should generally be handled by packaging a Cairngorm/Kingussie event and sending it off to the controller.</p>

<p><b>CONTROLLER:</b>  Your application's controller skeleton (which inherits from the framework controller class) is
implemented in <b>D:/_work/IPP/eRoof/eRoofNative/src/com/ebs/eroof/control/eRoofNativeController.as</b>.  Your controller is responsible for implementing
your application's business logic.  Cairngorm/Kingussie events are processed by the controller and sent off
to the appropriate command for processing.</p>

Areas where you need to add or edit code for your application have been marked with comments containing the <b>TODO:</b> tag.
