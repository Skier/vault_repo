	<!-- General Properties
version	:               The newest version number supported by this agent. 1 for snmpv1, 2 for snmpv2c, 3 for snmpv3
port:           	    SNMP agent UDP port number, default is 161
encryptPassword-
AndCommunity            If yes, all the unencrypted communities and passwords are changed to encrypted 
                        format and saved to file when agent starts. If no, values will not be changed, 
                        even if they're in encrypted format (but they will be decrypted). The length of 
                        communities and passwords must be less than 32 characters in order to be
                        successfully encrypted.
readCommunity:	        the community names for SNMP GET/GETNEXT/GETBULK 
                        operations. Names are separated by ","
                        No SNMP read operations is allowed if this field is empty
writeCommunity:	        the community names for SNMP SET. Names are separated by ","
                        No SNMP SET is allowed if this field is empty
maxPacketSize:	        max number of bytes in a packet. Note: The max packet 
                        size of ethernet is 1500 bytes.
useThreadPool:	        If yes, a thread pool is used to improve performance. 
                        But it also means more system resources are needed
engineID:	            SNMPv3's engineID of this agent. If it's empty, the first IP
	                    address found for the hostname of the machine will be used.
engineBoots:	        agent reboot times. Its value is updated whenever 
                        agent restarts if agent is a SNMPv3 agent
informTimeout:	        the timeout value for agent to send INFORM request, in milliseconds
informRetries:	        number of retries after timeout for INFORM request
reloadConfigOID:	    an OID for reloading this file. SNMP manager can issue a 
                        SET request with only this OID and its value is any integer, 
                        it forces agent to reload config file.
authTrapEnabled:        Possible values are "yes" or "no". If "yes", authenticationFailure
                        traps will be generated if authentication failed
ipAddress:  	        IP address of this agent. Agent will bind to this particular
	                    address, it's also used as one of the field in SNMPv1 
                        trap. the first IP address found for the hostname of the machine 
                        will be used if this field is empty.
masterAgentPort:        master agent TCP port number. 
remoteMasterAgentPort:  When this agent is a subagent, this property specifies the remote master
                        agent's listening port
remoteMasterAgentIpAddress:  When this agent is a subagent, this property specifies the remote master
                        agent's ip Address or host name
subagentIpAddresses:    IP addresses of authorized subagent, separated by ",". 
                        Empty value means accepting all IP addresses.
managerIpAddresses: 	IP addresses of authorized SNMP managers, separated by 
                        ",". Empty value means accepting all IP addresses.
system.sysObjectID:     It is used as Enterprise OID in SNMP V1 trap 

system.sysLocation system.sycContact  system.sysObjectID etc. :Static values for MIB objects. 
Use the format "GroupName.ScalarObject". Their values will be updated and saved if SNMP SET
changes their values. For example, if manager issues a SNMP SET to change sysContact's value
successfully, the sysContact value in config file will be updated and saved.These values will 
overwrite corresponding methods in java classes. For example, if system.sysLocation value is
"building1",  getSysLocation() method in SystemGroup class will be ignored, sysLocation will 
be always "building1". To make that method take effect, system.sysLocation needs to be deleted
from config file.
