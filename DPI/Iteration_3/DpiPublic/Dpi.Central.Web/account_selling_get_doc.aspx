		business is like a child that you have nurtured and cared for over the 
		years. It represents untold hours of your life invested in a labor of 
		love. It may be hard to imagine life without it. If it is successful, 
		you have high expectations for its value. If it is not successful, you 
		may be ready to be rid of it for any reasonable offer. Either way, not 
		only does it represent some portion of your wealth, but it also 
		represents your reputation. Your investors, business partners, agents, 
		employees, vendors, bankers, and most importantly of all, your 
		customers, all hold you accountable and responsible to be a good 
		steward. Selecting a buyer is a critical decision. You only want to do 
		this once and you want to do it right.</span></li>
		<li class="midgray_normal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">It 
		has been said that reputation is what others think of us. Character is 
		what we know ourselves to be. Long-term relationships are usually based 
		on strength of character. Persons of like character tend to bond 
		together because they see in one another a common set of virtues and 
		values. In business, people are often forced to deal successfully with 
		people of questionable character. But when it comes to the very personal 
		and individual decision to sell your business, you want not only to have 
		the protection of laws and iron-clad contracts, but you also want to 
		trust the character of the other party. Legal remedies to disputes are a 
		tedious, expensive and generally to be avoided. In difficult situations, 
		character rises to the surface.</span></li>

		<li class="midgray_normal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
		Talk to any RBOC, and they can describe an altogether too common 
		occurrence in Telecom, the cascading bankruptcy. Telecom accounts are 
		converted in mass from one failed OCN to another, only to find that the 
		new OCN progresses into yet another failure. There are stories of 
		unscrupulous individuals abandoning large debts, and slipping off into 
		the night, only to be back in business the next day under a new OCN, 
		with the same accounts. The RBOCs chase these debts through legal 
		nightmares, trying to collect what is owed to them. Imagine if you 
		blundered into a deal with one of these crooks, how would you be able to 
		protect yourself? Would you find yourself in a long line of unsatisfied 
		creditors, many of whom have extensive legal resources at their command?</span></li>

		<li class="midgray_normal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">You 
		don’t have to be in business very long before you will meet or know 
		individuals and companies that make their way in life by being 
		litigious. They draw their lawyers like a gun. They have a history of 
		lawsuits. They are quick to threaten legal action rather than resolve 
		issues amicably. They seldom live within the four corners of their 
		agreements and they manipulate the system to their advantage. They use 
		the cost and time involved in legal battles to try to coerce people into 
		accepting settlements that they would otherwise never agree to. Avoid 
		dealing with them. In any deal, there may evolve issues that require 
		resolution between the parties.</span></li>

		Like most of life, there is a right way and wrong way to do things. Many 
		of these lessons are best learned in the school of hard knocks. Every 
		merger and acquisition teaches lessons about best practices. Neither the 
		buyer nor the seller benefit from the mistakes that can be avoided with 
		the proper knowledge. Each deal is unique and decisions have to be made 
		about methods and processes. You want to deal with business partners who 
		are competent, capable and experienced. You need a buyer who is flexible 
		and adaptable, but who has the integrity to refuse a deal rather than 
		agree to something that won’t work for both parties. Find out how many 
		mergers and acquisitions prospective buyers have gone through. More 
		specifically, find out if they are experienced in buying Telecom 
		accounts. Do they have tried and true approaches that have been proven 
		to work? Are they savvy enough to ask the right questions and garner the 
		information needed to sculpt a deal that works for everyone affected?</span></li>

		<li class="midgray_normal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">As 
		you know, Telecom can vary significantly by Region, by State, by Zone, 
		by dominant ILEC, by CLEC and by product. &nbsp;Is the buyer licensed in your 
		geographic footprint? If not, is the buyer purchasing your licenses? 
		Does the buyer understand the deposit and bonding requirements? Does the 
		buyer understand the regulatory requirements imposed by the FCC and by 
		the various States? Does your buyer currently serve customers in your 
		same geographic footprint? Does your buyer understand the differences as 
		you move from one GEO code to the next? Does the buyer have 
		interconnection agreements and local wholesale agreements in place with 
		all of your underlying ILECs? If not, is the buyer assuming your 
		agreements? Will the buyer take over your OCN and retain your existing 
		Billing Account Numbers? &nbsp;Will the underlying vendors approve those 
		assumptions? Is the buyer going to service all of the accounts you are 
		selling? Do you have customers that are outside the buyer’s footprint

		Simply put, slamming is converting customers from one OCN to another 
		without complying with the regulations governing such conversions. 
		Structuring the transfer of accounts is the science of complying with 
		regulations while making the transfer as painless and transparent as 
		possible for the customers. Regulations impose severe penalties for 
		slamming. Does the buyer have regulatory counsel, and is the buyer aware 
		of these regulations? Does the buyer intend to comply with them? 
		Customer complaints to regulatory authorities may be unavoidable, but 
		should be minimized, and proper protections should be in place for both 
		buyer and seller. Depending upon your situation, it may be vitally 
		important that you are entirely comfortable with how the customers will 
		be converted. You may wish to seek the advice of regulatory counsel.<br>

take ownership of your facilities in order to service your customers? Are you

Wholesale and Resale? Will the buyer convert your Wholesale customers to Resale 
or visa versa? </span></p>

</span>Conversion – Until the customers are converted to the buyer’s OCN, they 
remain on your OCN and on your ILEC invoice. Once the customers are converted, 
the buyer will be charged a pro-rate for the partial month, plus a full month’s 
recurring charges, and you will receive a prorated credit. Will the buyer 
convert the customers from your OCN to the buyers OCN? If so, what will be the 
effective date of that conversion? What will trigger the conversion? Is a 
customer payment required? Is a customer LOA required? Is TPV required?</span></p>

them and continue to be charged with collecting those credits? Or will the buyer 
assume those disputes and take over the settlement process with the ILEC? Is the

Conclusion:</span></u></b></p>
<p class="midgray_normal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Selling your 
business is one of the most important decisions you will ever make. Buyer beware 
is commonly understood, but Seller beware is equally important. There are many 
potential pitfalls for the uninformed and inexperienced seller. The 10 things 
discussed in this document are important considerations when selling Telecom 
accounts. Any transaction of this importance needs to be a win-win. Mutual 
integrity is vital. Not only must the combined expertise and experience of both 
Seller and Buyer merge into a cohesive effort, sculpting a practical plan to 
provide reasonable assurance that both parties will be satisfied, but, perhaps 
more importantly, the parties must have the competency to execute the plan with 
reasonable precision. Select a buyer with a track record of success, and a tried 
and true approach that has been proven to work in actual practice.</span></p>
