Version 1.2.2.0
	Treatment after roolback
		Added IMap.Clear() after rollback since IMap data are no longer current. A good alternative would be 
		to make a deep copy of the hashtable before im.save() and replace the hashtable in case of rollback. 
		However, it could have negative performance impact, so, for now we will just clear IMap. 
	
		Another alternative is to
			1. Clone(copyAttrs) a record before changes are made, including changes to Remove rows 
			2. When IMap.save() is called to do the work (insert, update, delete) w/o changig RowState
		
				if Transaction.Commit() is successful
					Remove deleted
					For dirty rows, change attributes with values from copies, and get rid off clones
				else
					Replace Dirty with clone(copyAttrs)
					Remove new
		
			3. Finally, reset RowState to clean;
