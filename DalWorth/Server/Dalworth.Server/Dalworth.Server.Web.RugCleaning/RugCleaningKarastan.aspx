        <h1>Karastan Area Rug cleaning and repair in Dallas</h1>
        <h2> What are Karastan Area Rugs?</h2>
        
        <p>
          Karastan® rugs originated in 1928, when the American textile producer, Marshall Field, built a loom that could replicate the intricately 
          meticulous artistry of hand woven Oriental rugs. Karastan area rugs are woven in the United States from the highest quality worsted 
          New Zealand wool, which is considered to be the purest wool in the world. Karastan's weaving technology, 
          coupled with the superior grade of the wool fiber, ensures a very luxurious and well crafted product. 
          Moreover, great care and attention is given to the color, pattern and quality of the Karastan rug.  
          These luxurious machine made Oriental area rugs are made to appeal to every style preference, 
          from traditional to contemporary to casual and floral.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Wool area rugs are, in general, very easy to care of, as wool itself is a resilient fiber that resists spills naturally. 
            The manufacturing weaving technologies the Karastan brand employes ensure the end product is sturdy and durable. 
            With proper care and maintenance, Karastan rugs should last a life time, providing aesthetic beauty and pleasing the eye.
        </p>
        
        <h2>How to Care for Karastan Rugs?</h2>
        <p>
            Karastan® area rugs would benefit greatly from placing a pad underneath  to prevent sliding, reduce wear, 
            retain shape and cushion and add comfort underfoot. 
            In addition, regularly rotating a Karastan rug a few times every year would prevent uneven wear as well as fading from the sun. 
            Another regular care routine for a Karastan area rug would include vacuuming at least a couple of times every week for 
            the first year after purchasing a new Karastan rug to remove extra fuzz, or loose fibers that were produced during the weaving process. 
            After the first year, vacuuming should be done according to the traffic the Karastan area rug is exposed to

        <h2>How to Professionally Clean a Karastan Area Rug?</h2>
        <p>
           According to Karastan manufacturers, great care must be taken to ensure the proper cleaning of Karastan rugs. 
           Their web site, <a href="http://www.karastan.com/CarpetCare.aspx">How to care for Karastan rugs</a> recommends sending Karastan area rugs to a credible and reputable professional 
           area rug cleaner that has experience routinely cleaning Karastan and other high quality area rugs. 
           Although cleaning Karastan rugs at home is not recommended, in case there is a spill, 
           quick action is proposed by the manufacturers of Karastan® rugs to reduce the extent of the stain. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The following are Karastan area rug emergency care suggestions from Karastan manufacturers: 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In case of a spill, it is best to remove solids with a spoon or a knife, 
            scraping from the outer edge toward the center of the spill. Working in the direction of the pile is recommended. 
            Rubbing a spill is not to be done under any circumstances, as it will only entrench it further. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Absorbent white paper towels can be gently placed on the spill to blot and absorb as much of the liquid as possible. 
            That can be done until there is no more moisture being absorbed by the paper towel.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Washing the area with a small amount of warm water mixed with 
            carpet shampoo or mild dishwashing liquid and white vinegar can be tried to remove the stain completely.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In case the water solution does not remove the stain, a solvent may be used. 
            A few drops should first be applied to an inconspicuous area of the rug to make sure there are no color bleeds or any other detrimental effects. 
            Then, a white towel or tissue paper may be used for blotting. 
            Karastan recommends that solvent use must be in accordance to manufacturer directions. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            According to Karastan's manufacturers, solvent should be applied to the stain and worked gently with a spoon handle. 
            It should then be blotted thoroughly and promptly with a white paper towel. 
            This process may be carefully repeated several times until the stain is gone, making sure that the area is not overly wet, 
            as some solvents may damage the backing of some rugs as well as cause rings on the Karastan rug.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Some greasy stains may be taken care of by putting a white paper towel on the stain and ironing the paper towel for a few seconds. 
            The heat allows the grease to be absorbed by the paper.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A final suggestion from Karastan is to never walk on a wet area of a rug since that causes the deterioration of the rug. 
            To hasten the drying time of damp areas of the rug, a hairdryer may be used.

           You recommended applying the fiber protector after cleaning my Oriental rug and it was a great idea. 
           We had a spill a few weeks later and it did not soak into the rug. 
           I was able to take care of it quickly and the rug was not damaged. Thank you.

            I bought an amazing Oriental rug on my last trip to Turkey. When it was time to have it cleaned professionally, I called Dalworth. 
            The rug came back clean and ready to be displayed again.
