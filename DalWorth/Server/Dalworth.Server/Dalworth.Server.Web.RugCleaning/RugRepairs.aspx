        <h1>Professional Area, Oriental rug repairs in Dallas Fort Worth by Dalworth </h1>
        
        <p> 
        We offer a wide variety of Oriental and specialty, rug repair and restoration services in our Dallas facility.  
        Our Oriental rug repair specialists are trained and experienced in working with a variety of machine and hand made rugs, such as Oriental, 
        Persian, Indian, Afghan, Pakistani, Moroccan, Tunisian, Turkish,  Caucasian, Chinese,  Romanian, 
        Spanish, Navajo, and many other specialty rugs in our Dallas office. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending on your rug's repair needs and the monetary and sentimental value of the rug to you,  
            we can offer different levels of repair from patching to complete reweaving. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Regular professional rug cleaning and timely rug repair, in our Dallas facility, would insure the value and beauty of your Oriental rug.  
            It is important to inspect the rug periodically for any rug damage and normal wear 
            and tear to prevent more extensive and expensive rug repairs and restoration costs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Oriental rug repair is a unique art form, requiring craftsmanship, skill and understanding of rug construction.
        </p>
        <p>
            We utilize our knowledge of rug structure and our vast experience in the industry to 
            provide outstanding Oriental rug repair services to our customers in the Dallas metroplex.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Listed below are the most common rug repairs we provide in our Dallas plant.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Area Rug Fringe Repair in Dallas </h2>
        <p>
            We examine your Oriental rug to determine the type of fringe repair it requires based on rug construction.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your rug’s edges are hand knotted, they need to be rewrapped by hand, 
            paying close attention to the rug's colors and structure. 
            This is a very elaborate and meticulous process. If, on the other hand, 
            your Oriental rug is machine made, power fringing is appropriate and less time consuming. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like to completely change the fringe, 
            we have a wide variety of colors and fabrics to choose from, in our Dallas facility.  
            Some customers prefer to remove the fringe altogether.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Area Rug Edge Serging in Dallas</h2>
        <p>
            The sides of your Oriental rugs must be secured with wool, cotton or synthetic thread to protect them and keep them from unraveling.  
            This process of serging gives your rug a fine finished appearance. 
            We offer both hand serging and machine Serging, in our Dallas facility, depending on rug construction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before we begin the Serging process, we make sure your rug edges are solid enough.  
            If your rug edges require repairs, 
            we reinforce them prior to Serging to add durability and make the repairs last
        </p>
        
        <h2>Area Rug Edge Binding in Dallas</h2>
        <p>
            Binding is used primarily on tufted carpet which is made into rugs. 
            We take a narrow strip of fabric and place it over the raw edge of the rug 
            and then secure it to prevent fraying. 
            This gives your rug a nice finished look.
        </p>
        
        <h2> Area Rug Patching in Dallas</h2>
        <p>
            For many Oriental rugs, patching may be economically 
            and aesthetically the best repair choice.  
            We recommend that patching be done as soon as holes are discovered 
            to prevent more extensive damage.
        </p>
        
        <h2> Oriental Rug Reweaving in Dallas</h2>
        <p>
            Depending on the value of the Oriental rug and the extent of the damage, 
            we may recommend our rug reweaving process, in our Dallas office.    
            This is the most thorough, time consuming, 
            yet  undoubtedly the best method to repair your Oriental rug closest to its original condition.
        </p>
        <p>
            We clean the damaged area and sew new threads matching the texture and color of the original 
            rug into the hole to rebuild the foundation of your rug. Once that task is accomplished, 
            we must precisely duplicate the knots in the original design so repairs are not noticeable. 
        </p>
        
        <h2> Rug Backing repair in Dallas</h2>
        <p>
            We see different types of backing on a variety of Oriental rugs, from hooked rugs to machine rugs. 
            Backing will extend the life of your rug by protecting the back and in some cases, 
            by helping secure the rug’s knots in place. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like to replace your old or worn out backing, we have many types to choose from.
        </p>
