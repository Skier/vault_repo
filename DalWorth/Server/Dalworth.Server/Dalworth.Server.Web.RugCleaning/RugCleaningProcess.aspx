        <p>
            Our results speak for themselves. 
            Please see <a href="<%Response.Write(Link.CUSTOMER_REVIEWS);%>">Rug Cleaning Customer Reviews</a> for feedback about our Oriental rug cleaning. 
            Persian hand knotted rugs as well as Chinese machine made rugs are routinely cleaned in our Oriental rug facility. 
            We have expertise handling high end Karastan and Carousel Mills rugs as well as specialty Flokati and Navajo rugs. 
            We customize area rug cleaning methods to fit the fibers, dyes and the various other specificities of each rug.   
            At Dalworth, we are dedicated professionals striving to meet and exceed your expectations with our attention to 
            detail and our meticulous step by step area rug cleaning process.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Step 1: Initial inspection and rug pick up</h2>
        <p> 
           We dispatch a Dalworth technician to your home or office to measure as well 
           as pre-inspect your rug. Our technician gives an estimate and, 
           if you are satisfied with the quote, the technician picks up the rug. If necessary, 
           our technician will move your furniture in order to safely pick up the rug. 
           It is then delivered to our state of the art Oriental rug cleaning facility.   
        </p>
        
        <h2>Step 2: Follow up detailed rug inspection </h2>
        <p>
            Once the rug is in our area rug cleaning facility, 
            a certified rug specialist re-measures it and thoroughly inspects your rug again.  
            The construction of the rug and the type of fiber the rug is made of help determine the cleaning method, 
            cleaning products and drying time. This step also reveals crucial information about 
            the rug's pre-existing condition.   

            We investigate and document rug damage, such as:
        </p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Dry and wet rot</li>
            <li>Mold and mildew</li>
            <li>Dye stains, color bleeding, discoloration and browning</li>
            <li>Rug spots, rug stains</li>
            <li>Fading</li>
            <li>Worn and rotten fringes</li>
            <li>Pet odors and waste, such as pet urine, feces and vomit</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>
            If our inspection reveals that repair is warranted prior to cleaning, 
            in order to prevent further damage, we contact our customer with the information 
            and a recommended course of action.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When a plan has been determined and approved for execution, 
            the actual area rug cleaning process begins. 
        </p>
        
         <h2>Step 3: Compressed air dusting</h2>
        <p>
            Using compressed air, we dust the rug on both sides. 
            This rug cleaning step is amazingly gentle, 
            yet highly effective at removing literally pounds of dust, 
            dirt and small particles from the rug, which is impossible 
            to remove with your standard vacuum cleaner.
        </p>
        
        <h2>
        	Step 4: Clear water rug cleaning, immersion wash and rinse
        </h2>
        <p>
            As we test the rug for colorfastness, 
            we determine the degree of moisture the rug requires for best rug cleaning results. 
            Gentle cleaning agents are selected based on rug condition and a clear water rinse washes out all removable stains, dirt and odors. 
            This rug cleaning process is done by hand and is repeated until we are satisfied with the results and 
            until the water that comes out of the rug is totally clear. 
        </p>
        
        <h2> Step 5: Fresh air rug drying</h2>        
        <p>
            We use fresh air breeze to gently dry your rug. 
            Some rugs are hung to dry naturally, using gravity to pull water out, 
            while other rugs are dried flat. Air drying methods depend on rug type.
        </p>
        
        <h2> Step 6: Rug combing, brushing and fluffing</h2>
        <p>
            As the rug dries, we use combing, 
            brushing and / or pile fluffing techniques for the most luxurious results.
        </p>
        
        <h2> Step 7: Rug fringe cleaning and grooming</h2>
        <p>
            Once the rug is dry, we groom the fringes by putting 
            the final rug cleaning touches as well as hand combing and trimming the edges.
        </p>
        
        <h2> Step 8: Post cleaning vacuuming and inspection</h2>
        <p>
            When rug cleaning is complete, we vacuum the rug again, 
            trim any loose fibers and do one final inspection to make sure the 
            rug cleaning results satisfy our high standards.
        </p>
        
        <h2> 	Step 9: Optional application of rug fiber protector, moth deterrent and rug pad </h2>
        <p>
        Per the customer's request and as an optional service, 
        we can apply moth deterrent and fiber protector as well as install non skid pads to prolong 
        the life and beauty of your fine rug.
        </p>
                
        <h2> Step 10: Rug delivery</h2>
        <p>
            Your rug is safely delivered and brought into your home. 
            In addition, we move any furniture that needs to be moved to install the rug properly.
        </p>
       
       <p>
            Our work is guaranteed.  We will do everything to make sure you are <strong>100% satisfied </strong> 
            with our rug cleaning services.
