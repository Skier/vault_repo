        <h1>Area Oriental Rug Home Care Tips</h1>
        <h2> How do I prevent my rug from becoming dirty in the first place? </h2>
        <p>
            There are simple ways to prevent a rug from becoming soiled:
            Do not eat or drink on the rug to prevent spills and food stains.
            Remove your shoes when you enter the home to prevent tracking outside dirt into your home and onto your rug.  
            Wear slippers, socks or walk barefoot on the rug as outside shoes are much rougher and heavier. 
            Vacuum your rugs regularly.  Even if you care for your rugs very well, 
            it does not replace the need for regular professional rug cleaning.
        </p>
        <h2>How often should I vacuum my rugs at home? </h2>
        <p>
            In most cases, regular vacuuming is recommended, 
            to prevent dirt from burrowing deeper into the pile and causing greater wear. 
            However, make sure you are careful with the power brush in the vacuum head, 
            as it may cause damage on an Oriental or specialty rug if used too vigorously. 
            For a weekly maintenance vacuuming, use the vacuum nozzle, especially at the fringe area, 
            where the rotating action of the brush can shred the fringe or cause significant damage. 
        </p>
        <h2>What can I do if I have a spill on my rug such as pet urine, 
            child diaper accidents, wine stains, food stains? </h2>
        <p>
            It is best to clean spills as soon as possible. 
            With paper towels or a clean white cloth, 
            blot the area and make sure you contain it as much as possible by working from the edges of the 
            spill toward the center. This should prevent the spill from spreading. 
            Do not use any bleaches or detergents on a valuable Oriental or specialty area rug. 
            Use only plain water to clean spills. If the stain can not be removed, 
            call us to come and assess the damage.
        </p>
        <h2>Should I ever turn my rug? </h2>
        <p>
        <strong>Yes.</strong> If the rug is in direct sun light, 
        it will fade over time, especially if the rug is antique and the dyes are natural. 
        It is best to invest in drapes or move the rug to another area that has less direct sun light. 
        Even with minimal sun light, it is best to turn the rug 180 degrees once every year to prevent 
        uneven wear and sun damage.
        </p>
        <h2>How can I tell if I have moth damage? </h2>
        <p>
        There are usually bare spots in the rug, where the larvae has eaten the wool fibers. 
        In a particularly bad infestation, there is a very fine, thin web covering an area of the rug. 
        In addition, there may be waste particles that look like sand granules in the pile of the rug.
