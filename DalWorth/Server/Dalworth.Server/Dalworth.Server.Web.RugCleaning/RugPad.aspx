        <h1>Oriental Area Rug Pads by Dalworth in Dallas Fort Worth</h1>
        <h2>What is a rug pad?</h2>
        <p>
            Rug pads are a protective material that is placed under an area rug to prevent slippage, 
            absorb sound, extend the life of the Oriental area rug and make the rug feel softer and 
            more luxurious under your feet.  Older rugs, smaller rugs, extra thin and soft rugs, 
            rugs that have been patched and repaired, and rugs with weak foundations are especially in need of rug pads. 
            However, in general, rug pads are essential for all types, sizes and thicknesses of rugs. 
            Regardless of your area rug's condition or origin, 
            a good rug pad will preserve and protect as well as extend the life of your Oriental, 
            area or specialty rug by a few decades – and that is a sound investment. 
        </p>
        <h2> Recommended rug pads by Dalworth</h2>
        <p> 
            Although there are may rug pads on the market to choose from, there are two types of desirable rug pads, 
            which are consistently recommended by Oriental and specialty area rug experts: rubber and synthetic felt. 
            Our rug pad is a perfect combination of the two. We use and recommend a flat firm rubber pad 
            with a layer of horse hair on top. This type of dense pad is right for both hardwood floors as well 
            as carpet as it grips well to either one and prevents rug movement and sliding. 
        </p>
        
        <h2> Custom cut Oriental rug pads</h2>
        <p>
            We custom cut all our pads in out rug facility, so we can accommodate any size you may need. 
            Keep in mind that the pad should be cut one inch shorter than your rug all the way around, 
            excluding the fringe.
