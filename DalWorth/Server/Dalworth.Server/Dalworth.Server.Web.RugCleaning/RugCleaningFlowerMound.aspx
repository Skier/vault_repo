           We have three Oriental rugs and two German Shepherds. We needed to get a lot of doggie stuff out of our rugs, if you know what I mean...  You did a great job and got the smell and stains out completely. We were thoroughly impressed.

            I just had to write and let you know that you do a fantastic job for us whenever we need your help in getting our Oriental rugs professionally cleaned. We have used you on several occasions in the past thirteen or so years.

            Dalworth moved all my furniture, got my rug, cleaned it and delivered it on time and then moved all the furniture back the way it was. The price was right and the service was outstanding. In addition to all that, the pick up and delivery were free.
