          <div class="comment">You were recommended to me by a friend and I'm glad I called you after 
          the  “accident” on my rug.  The rug itself is not very valuable or expensive, 
          but I like it and it goes well with my décor.  
          I thought it would a shame to get rid of it if the stains would not come out, 
          but you did a great job and I am very pleased. </div>

            My grandmother left me a beautiful Navajo rug that used to belong to her mother. 
            It was pretty old and worn but I could not bear to part with it. 
            You repaired and restored my rug beautifully. Thank you.
