          I wanted to write and thank Jeannette for cleaning my beautiful flokati rug after the mess my dog left behind. 
          My lab is usually well trained, but she was sick and vomited and urinated on the rug. 
          I tried to clean it as best as I could, but the smell and stain were still there, 
          so I realized it was a job for professional rug cleaners. I called 
          several companies around and chose Dalworth. 
          I am so glad I did. My flokati smells fresh and the stain is gone.  Thank you.
