        <h2>Area Rug Moth Repellent in Dallas</h2>
        <p>
            Moth larvae consume wool and silk fibers and threaten the beauty and longevity of your fine Oriental rug. 
            Prevention is the best method of protecting it from damage. 
            At Dalworth, we apply a moth repellent solution that will help deter moths and their larvae. 
            It is best to professionally clean the rug prior to applying moth repellent.

        <h2>Rug Fiber Protector in Dallas</h2>
        <p>
            Applying a fiber protector retards soiling and helps prevents stains from becoming permanent. 
            It is safe, non toxic and provides equal protection on various natural and synthetic Oriental 
            rug fibers such as wool, silk, cotton, sisal, nylon, rayon, olefin, polyester, acrylic and various blends.

        <h2>Rug Pad in Dallas</h2>
        <p>
            A quality pad is a sound investment in protecting and preserving your rug. 
            We customize the size and thickness of the pad to reduce friction between the floor and the rug. 
            The pad stabilizes the rug, 
            enhances safety by reducing slipping and provides an added layer of sound absorption.

        <h2>Rug Storage in Dallas</h2>
         <p>
            When you need to temporarily store your fine Oriental area rug, please give us a call. 
            Just as you need to properly maintain an Oriental area rug when it is being displayed, you must also take proper 
            care of it when it is being stored.  For optimal results, it is best to professionally clean your Oriental rug and 
            apply moth repellent prior to storage. We roll and wrap the rug carefully with a special breathable paper designed 
            for Oriental and Persian area rugs to prevent any creases or folding marks. We then store your rug in a cool, 
            dry and well ventilated area in our temperature controlled Dallas facility.
