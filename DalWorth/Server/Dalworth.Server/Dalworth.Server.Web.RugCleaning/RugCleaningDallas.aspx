           Thank you for a fantastic service. You have a great team of professionals and we appreciate you moving the furniture 
           at pick up and then putting it all back carefully at delivery time. Our rug looks and smells great and we appreciate the rug 
           pad installation as well. You said we'd like it and we really do – it is a lot more cushy and soft under our feet. Many thanks

            My silk tapestries were repaired, washed and returned to me within four days. I was concerned the dye may bleed and was worried 
            about the delicate material being ruined, but my daughter talked me into letting you take care of  my tapestries. 
            I am so impressed with the results, I will let you clean my lovely Persian rug next.

            I call you every year at my spring cleaning time, and you always do a wonderful job on my old rug to make sure it looks its best.
