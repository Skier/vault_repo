        <h1>Persian Rug Cleaning in Dallas Fort Worth by Dalworth</h1>
        <p>
           Persian rugs originated in various villages and cities in Persia, modern day Iran. 
           The many intricate designs were named after the different cities where they were produced. 
           As these designs were later recreated in other parts of the world, they still kept their original city names, 
           such as Sarouk, Hamadan, Kerman, Gabbeh, Tabriz, Isfahan, Bidjar and others. 
           The main characteristics of Persian rugs are rich color combinations, thick pile and intricate designs. 
           These lovely heirloom rugs require appropriate Persian rug cleaning to make sure the vibrant colors do not bleed. 
           Persian rugs are usually made out of wool or silk and are made to last, with proper Persian rug cleaning, 
           care and maintenance.  Our Persian wool rug cleaning methods are safe and were tested repeatedly over the 
           past few decades. Our Dallas Persian rug cleaning facility is dedicated to providing the best and most 
           thorough Persian rug cleaning and repair services our customers have come to expect from us.
