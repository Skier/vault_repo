          <div class="question" id="c1">
            <h3>How often should I clean my rug?</h3>
            <p> 
                The time frame for cleaning a rug depends on how much traffic it gets. 
                We recommend professional rug cleaning be performed every 1-3 years.         
            </p>

            <h3>How do I determine when it is time to clean my rug?</h3>
            <p>  
                To determine if it's time to clean your rug, try these simple tests:        
            </p>
            <p>
                Rub your palm on the rug for a few seconds. 
                If your hand becomes dirty, it is time for cleaning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kneel down on the rug and smells it. 
                If you detect foul odor, it is time to have it cleaned.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lift a rug corner and vigorously shake it up and down once or twice. 
                If you see a dust cloud forming, it is definitely time for a cleaning.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the rug facing up, fold a corner of the rug back, away from the pile, to expose the base of the fibers.  
                Have the rug professionally cleaned if there is dirt deep in the pile.   
            </p>
            <a href="#">Back to the top of the page</a>
          </div>
          <div class="question" id="c3">
            <h3>Do you guarantee pet odor removal?</h3>
            <p>
                It really depends on the condition of the rug. 
                More often than not, we are able to remove all pet odors.  
                We do not 100% guarantee pet or stain removal.         
            </p>

            <h3>Do you guarantee stain removal?</h3>
            <p> 
                If a stain has not affected the fibers permanently, we have a much higher chance to remove it.  
                Please call us as soon as you notice the stain since taking care of 
                it as early as possible increases our chance of success.

            <h3>Is my rug even worth cleaning?</h3>
            <p> 
                That is a personal decision depending on your emotional attachment, 
                if any, to the rug and the replacement value of the rug. 
                Many people design a whole room around their Oriental rug and replacing it could require refurnishing the entire room. 
                It may be cheaper to repair and clean the rug. We will be happy to give you a professional estimate 
                for cleaning and necessary repairs to help you make an informed decision.

                There are many factors to consider when professionally cleaning an Oriental rug. 
                We inspect your rug carefully to determine what method is safe to use. 
                Our technicians are trained, experienced and certified to handle your investment properly.

                the stain and odor may still be present.

                dyes and other specificities of your rug.

            <p>
                Possibly. It really depends on the extent of the damage. 
                Another concern would be with the water and dampness from the leaky pot potentially 
                causing the foundation of the rug to become brittle. 
                Please give us a call so we can evaluate your rug.

            <h3>What can I do if I have a flood or water damage on my rug? </h3>
            <p> 
            If the rug is not dried properly and completely, the cotton foundation may become weak and rot as a result. 
            Mold and bacteria may also thrive in such a damp environment. 
            It is best to have the rug professionally cleaned and dried.

            <h3>Do you just have one method of cleaning rugs? </h3>
            <p>
                Every rug we clean gets a complete evaluation to determine the condition 
                of the rug and the type of fiber and dyes used in its construction. 
                We customize our specialty rug cleaning process to fit each rug individually.

            <h3>Do you bleach my fringe? </h3>
            <p>
                We do not bleach the fringe because chlorine based bleaches damage the fiber by weakening it. 
                However, we do have specialty non chlorine products that we can use to make fringes whiter.
