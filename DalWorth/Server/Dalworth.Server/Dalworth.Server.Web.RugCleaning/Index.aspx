        <h2>Why Dallas professional Oriental area rug cleaners? </h2>
        <p>  
            One does not go to a car mechanic for tooth extraction. 
            The same logic applies to proper Persian or Oriental rug cleaning, 
            as these fine area rugs are in many cases items of pride and beauty in the home. 
            They are prized possessions or possibly treasured family heirlooms and as such 
            should not be treated carelessly.  
        </p>
        
        <p> The Institute of Inspection, Cleaning and Restoration Certification
          (<a href="http://www.certifiedcleaners.org/default.shtml">IICRC</a>)
          Standard S-100 states that</p>
        <blockquote>"When practical, the preferred system for cleaning rugs is
          to remove them from the customer's home or business and clean them
          in a controlled 'in-plant' environment." 
          It further states that, "Failure to perform specialized procedures
          may result in permanent damage to the rug and/or flooring under and
          around the rug." </blockquote>
        <p> Persian and Oriental area rug cleaning must be professionally done for the following reasons: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Dust collected inside the rug damages the fibers over time  </li>
          <li> Odors and pet waste such as urine, feces and vomit can not be 
                removed effectively by home based methods or by regular carpet 
                cleaning companies 
           </li>
                
          <li> Household methods can damage the area rug and change its color </li>
          <li> Different rug types require special professional rug cleaning processes </li>
          <li> Rug repairs must be done before further damage occurs </li>
          <li> Furniture must be removed carefully to prevent damaging the rug </li>
        </ul>
