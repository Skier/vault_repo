            We will recommend you to friends and family. 
            You literally rescued our Oriental rug from moth larvae before greater damage was done. 
            Thank you for adding the moth repellent application.

            I didn't know I was supposed to rotate our Kilim area rug to prevent sun damage and fading. 
            By the time I realized there was a problem and called Dalworth, the damage to my rug was already done. 
            Linda was great in that she took the rug for cleaning and when the rug was delivered, 
            she showed me how to rearrange my furniture on it, so the faded area did not show. 
            I appreciate all the extra time she spent at my house making sure I was happy with the results.
